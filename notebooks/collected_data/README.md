## Directory to store generated GAP data from GitHub

This folder is used to store the JSON files created when running the notebooks for data extraction, which are accessed for analysis and visualisation after they have been generated, as well as the outputs from data analysis and data visualisation.Please do not modify variable names or other content directly in the data collection JSON files, as it will impact the program's ability to access and process the data.
