    "This Jupyter Notebook can be used to extract metrics for monitoring purposes, mainly based on the PackageDistro repository from the gap-system organisation on GitHub. As the distribution of GAP is managed through this repository, pulling and analysing data from its current release workflows can be useful in obtaining an overview for the purpose of redistribution. The PackageDistro repository is automatically accessing information on GAP package distribution, as it contains metadata from all the GAP packages. "

As such, extracting, analysing and combining this information can provide data what packages could and should be considered in a new release of the system. By comparing current versions to what is in the repository, the user can obtain some predictions as to what the next released GAP version will look like. Running the script will export the data to a 'distro_data.json' file in the 'collected_data' folder, displaying the results of the generated data per package."
